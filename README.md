# Simple-Speaker
A ROBLOX Game Development creation made by me.

**Getting Started**

Use this in your game to provide cool effects for users to view and listen too.

Download the model and open up a new empty ROBLOX studio experience. Insert the speaker model into the experience and change the Sound ID located inside the Controller Script to a Sound ID of your choice. After that, hit play and watch in awe.
