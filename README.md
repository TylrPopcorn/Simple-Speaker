# Simple-Speaker
A ROBLOX Game Development creation made by me.

----
**Getting Started**

This model simply provides a cool effect that can be used in your game. It simulates a speaker with similar functions like a real life speaker. Depending on bass, the bumper will move along to the bass. The speaker itself has a cool light effect that is played while sound is active as well.

Download the model and open up a new empty ROBLOX studio experience. Insert the speaker model into the experience and change the Sound ID located inside the Controller Script to a Sound ID of your choice. After that, hit play and watch in awe.

```
local MUSIC = "SOUND_ID_HERE" <--- Put your sound ID inside this variable located inside of the Controller script.
```
